All the items below, except those under the feature heading, must
be fixed (or ignored when irrelevant) before the nick_0_3 branch
can move to trunk. When the branch enters trunk, it's important
we work towards a stable version, so we can release a 0.2.90.1
(0.3 beta 1) version as soon as possible (if needed, independent
from the Xfce release schedule).


Interface
=========
- Test the application with a screen reader and add Atk objects
  where needed.
- Check the search and replace code for bugs.
- Add option to disable the search feedback in the replace dialog
  (highlight, count matches, type-ahead). This can slow down mousepad
  with (multiple) large documents.
- Transpose words works a bit odd sometimes.
- Improve replace (all) in selection.


Saving and loading
==================
- Cleanup and improve encoding support and order the encoding types.


Other
=====
- We need a cool Mousepad logo.
- Write documentation.
- Session manager support (waiting for Gtk+ here).


Testing and polishing
=====================
- Profiling loading large files (Gtk/Pango has a problem here). This
  also locks some dialogs.
- Checking for memory leaks.


Feature
=======
- You'll never know. No promisses here...
- GIO.
