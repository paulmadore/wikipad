What is it?
===========

Wikipad is a Mousepad derivative with the intent of making Wikipedia editing
easier. 


The Wikipad Mission
====================

Ultimately, user should be able to graphically create Wikipedia articles 
with little or not interruption from having to know how formatting works. It is
an archaic idea that users must learn formatting in order to submit information
to something like MediaWiki. If Wikipad is successful, this will change. 


Required packages
=================

Wikipad depends on:

 - Gtk+ 2.24.0 or above
 - GLib 2.30.0 or above
 - Libxfce4util 4.4.0 or above
 - GtkSourceView 2.2.2 or above

The following packages are optional:

 - D-BUS 0.34 or above (strongly suggested)


Installation
============

The file 'INSTALL' contains generic installation
instructions.
